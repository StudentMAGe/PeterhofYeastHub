<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This hub hosts assemblies of several <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em> strains belonging to the <strong>Peterhof genetic collection</strong>
 and SNV tracks relative to the sacCer3 genome assembly.</p>

<h3> sacCer3/ </h3>
<p>These tracks contain information about single nucleotide variations in several  <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em> strains of the Peterhof genetic collection.
For each strain, there are two separate tracks, one for substituions (SNV) and the other for short indels. </p>

<h3> 15V_P4/ </h3>

<p> This part of the hub shows assembly of the 15V-P4 strain, one of the progenitor strains for the whole collection. </p>


<h3> 1B_D1606/ </h3>

<p> This part of the hub features assembly of 1B-D1606, a hybrid strain descending to both Peterhof and S288C-related collections of yeast strains. </p>


<h3> compare_annotations/ (ex-15V_contigs/) </h3>
<p> This part of the hub collects (and allows one to compare) sets of annotations derived with different algorithms (listed as track names). </p>
<p> It is based on a slightly different assembly than the "final" 15V-P4 assembly, so contig names may be different. </p>
This work was done as a project in the Bioinformatics Institute <a href="http://bioinformaticsinstitute.ru/"> http://bioinformaticsinstitute.ru/</a>.

This part mostly serves educational purposes and is unlikely to be updated. 

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p> Genomes were assembled <i> de novo </i> with SPAdes v3.1 and scaffolded with chromosomer. Comprehensive sets of genome annotations were created with Maker2. </p>

<p>For SNV analysis, short reads were aligned with bowtie v2.1.0; SNV calling was performed with samtools v1.0 mpileup. SNVs with quality less than 30 or DP 
less than 3, as well as heterozygous indels,  were filtered out. The resulting files were annotated with SnpEff v4.1. </p>
