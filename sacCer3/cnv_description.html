<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The tracks labeled 'amplified' or 'deleted' contain information about regions which are presumably amplified or deleted <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em> strains of the Peterhof genetic collection. 
For more information on strains please see <a href=http://public.dobzhanskycenter.ru/PeterhofYeastHub/hub_contents.html> the description page</a>.


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p> Copy number variation was estimated with the mrCaNaVaR pipeline [Alkan et al., 2009]. Subsequent analysis was performed with R. Windows with normalized copy number above 1.8 were considered as amplified while those with copy number below 0.3 were considered as deleted. Windows were merged to calculate length of regions and intersected with reference genome annotation to produce lists of presumably amplified or missing genes. </p>
