<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These tracks contain information about single nucleotide variations in several  <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em> strains of the Peterhof genetic collection. 
For each strain, there are two separate tracks, one for substituions (SNV) and the other for short indels. </p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
Short reads were aligned with bowtie v2.1.0; SNV calling was performed with samtools v1.0 mpileup. SNVs with quality <30 or DP <1, as well as heterozygous indels, 
 were filtered out. The resulting files were annotated with SnpEff v4.1.
