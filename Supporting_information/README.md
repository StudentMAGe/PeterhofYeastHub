This directory contains files used to create the figures in the [Drozdova *et al.*, 2016](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0154722) paper.

#### ./Sequences
Here you can find the sequences used for phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1 and Fig. S2B). Please note that CDS sequences for strains other than PGC were taken from the [*Saccharomyces* genome database](http://yeastgenome.org/download-data/sequence); only sequences for the 807 genes used in our analysis (see Fig. 1B) are uploaded here.

Data for most strains (94/95 at Fig. 1A and 94/97 at Fig. S2B) were taken from the [*Saccharomyces cerevisiae* 100-genomes project](http://genome.cshlp.org/content/25/5/762) and provided courtesy of Daniel A. Skelly (https://github.com/daskelly/yeast100genomes).

#### ./Alignments
This directory contains processed data (final alignments / vcf). The vcf file is based on the one provided by Daniel A. Skelly (https://github.com/daskelly/yeast100genomes).
